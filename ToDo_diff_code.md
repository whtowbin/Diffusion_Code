# Diffusion code to do list for meeting with Terry.
- Estimate how long olivine took to reach present concnetration. Use boundary condition at depthself.
- Put distance on points. Make center zero and then measure distance too rims
- calcuate boundary condition for different partitioning values.
- Cacluate length of Stalling ... 0.5 - 2 hours...
- Caculate time for ascent ... ascent rate and change in pressure. from storage depth to surface. + Surface cooling ~ 10 minutes.

- give min time range for olivine water loss since ascent started.

- Cacluate time for CPX to lose water
- Measure Profile for Opx too.
- Conclude that if CPX and Opx can lose water in this time scale they very likely equilibrated with the magma during ascent.


- I am unsure what Diffusivity to use for CPX. Elizabeth has several. Wood et al . 2000? somewhere between 10^-11.5 and 10^-12

- What Should I assume for the Opx diffusivity? 10^-11 ?

For now I will use my code for the beginning then megan's code to finish the fits.
